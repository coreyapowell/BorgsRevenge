This is a collection of code snippets I might reference to someone, or I might not  have USB or email access.

build.bat - I really needed to run multiple compilers in one place in windows. man, windows has certainly changed since win10!
cmakebuild.bat - I am making the same project over and over and over..... but it's only in the build directories. I can make changes in one place.
